# Smart-Flood-Management-System-using-IoT-and-Drone-
This project is submitted for a high school level hackathon under the project name **Say Something**.

## Team Members:
- Priti Das Dipa (Leader)
- Partho Das
- Alimun Hak Munna 
- SK Tahim 
- Shuvojit Saha 

## Problem Statement:
Flooding in rural areas causes severe damage to agriculture, education, and daily life. There is a lack of early warning systems and data management to reduce these losses.

## Our Solution:
We propose a smart cloud-based flood management system using **IoT sensors** and **drones** that:
- Detect flood levels in real-time using sensors
- Collect data through drones
- Send data to a central cloud server
- Provide early warning alerts to communities via mobile app/SMS
- Help local governments make quick decisions using a dashboard

## Technologies Used:
- Drones (DJI or custom with Arduino)
- IoT sensors (water level, rain gauge)
- Cloud Storage (Google Cloud / AWS - idea stage)
- Python (data handling)
- JavaScript (frontend for dashboard)
- Firebase (app notification system)

## Project Status:
- Presentation video: ✅
- Slide deck: ✅
- Demo video: in progress
- Code prototype: basic

## Future Work:
- Build a real drone with sensors
- Connect it to a real-time cloud database
- Develop a mobile app for alerts
- Partner with local NGOs for testing
